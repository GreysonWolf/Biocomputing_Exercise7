#code that creates a list of length 5

hundreds <- seq(from =100, to =1000, by =100) 
    #creates a vector with length 10 containing 100, 200, . . . , 1000
football <- data.frame(NotreDame=58, Pittsburgh=7)
    #creates a two by two data frame with the teams and final score from last weekâ€™s Notre Dame football game
integers <- matrix(1:50, nrow = 10, ncol = 5)
    #creates a 10-row, 5-column matrix containing integers from 1 to 50
letters <- c("a", "b", "c")
    #creates a vector containing three letters
list(hundreds, football, 999, integers, letters)
    #creates the final list with all vectors created and the number 999 for a total the length of 5
